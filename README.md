This repository contains following Docker resources:

The WSO2 API Manager and API Manager Analytics Dockerfiles build generic Docker images <br>
for deploying API Manager and API Manager Analytics in containerized environments. They<br>
include the JDK, product distributions and a collection of utility libraries. Configurations, JDBC<br>
driver, extensions and other deployable artifacts are designed to be provided via volume mounts.
